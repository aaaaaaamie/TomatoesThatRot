TomatoesThatRot
===============

This is something that does what RottenTomatoes does but with a lot less. :/


Time spent: around 15 hours.
Hopefully I finished all the basic requirement and the additional requirement.
For optionals I did customized navigation bar, load the low-res image first then switch to high-res, fade in/out error message.
